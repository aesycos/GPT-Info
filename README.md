# GPT-Info
Collection of info about GPT

GUID Partition Types is scraped from the [GPT fdisk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gptfdisk/) project by Roderick W. Smith "[parttypes.cc](https://sourceforge.net/p/gptfdisk/code/ci/master/tree/parttypes.cc)" file.

I just wanted an easily managble collection of the GUIDs.
